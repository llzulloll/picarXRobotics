# ðŸ¤– PiCar Autonomous Line-Following Robot

A Raspberry Pi-powered robot designed to follow lines using grayscale sensors autonomously. This project involved tuning sensor thresholds, optimizing turn responsiveness, and refining logic for stable navigation through curves and intersections.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features
- Grayscale sensor calibration for precise edge detection
- Dynamic steering control based on sensor input
- HTML documentation of system setup and logic flow
- Responsive path correction for line breaks and junctions

## ðŸ›  Tools & Tech
- Raspberry Pi
- Python
- GPIO control
- HTML (project documentation)

## ðŸš— What I Learned
- Embedded systems debugging
- Real-time sensor data processing
- Fine-tuning control algorithms for stability and precision
